# Contributing
The developpment of the analysis package is more then welcome. So feel free to contribute with your ideas

## Contributing procedure
I inspire you one to use separate branch for the developpment of your analysis. Thus you can incorporate changes made to the dev brancsh to your analysis at any time. If you want to contribute to dev branch, create a marge request and ask for the review, so the people can see what exactly you changed and how it may affect other analysis.

## Styling convention
Please follow the simple code convention we have in the package so far:
1. leave an underscope `_` before the class variablen
2. Comment your vars and functions. The best way is to follow `///` Doxygen comment convention

## Others
If you want to upload notebooks, please remove the whole output: grapphs, printouts, etc.
